# Code Playground

Personally, I find it really hard to come up with unique ideas for side projects. There are many great open source projects for virtually anything you can think of.

So to forget about coming up with a great project idea, this repo is just my play ground. It hosts all the things I've been tinkering with. 

There might be some more education based stuff, but mostly this repo is just for the joy of coding.
